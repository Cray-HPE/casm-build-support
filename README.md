## Process Topics:

1. Make an issue in: [Casm Build Epic](https://connect.us.cray.com/jira/browse/CASMTRIAGE-1913)
   1. add label `casm-build`
   2. post link to ticket in `casm-oss-transition`
2. As we solve issues, ideally we could come up with some sort of knowledge article if its a common issue and push it back into [casm-build-support].  
   1. We can use wiki's?
   2. ideally we are creating something digestible for engineers to be able to 'go and do' that can enhance our institutuional knowledge and lets us make evolutionary forward progress.
