## Process Topics:

1. Make an issue in: [Casm Build Epic](https://connect.us.cray.com/jira/browse/CASMTRIAGE-1913)
   1. add label `casm-build`
   2. post link to ticket in `casm-oss-transition`
2. Each team needs to have 'build SME(s)' that they are developing.
   1. HMS - 
   2. CMS - 
   3. PET - 
   4. CLOUD - 
   5. MTL - 
3. We should have a weekly rotation where casm-build issues can get reffered to the SME on call.  NOTE: We are ABSOLUTELY going to have to develop build maturity accross the entire org, all of us. If teams don't want to participate then they wont get support :) (this is a confederation).  
4. As we solve issues, ideally we could come up with some sort of knowledge article if its a common issue and push it back into [casm-build-support].  
   1. We can use wiki's?
   2. ideally we are creating something digestible for engineers to be able to 'go and do' that can enhance our institutuional knowledge and lets us make evolutionary forward progress.
